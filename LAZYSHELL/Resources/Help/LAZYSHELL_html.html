 either the SNES9X or ZSNES emulator file to use when opening the 
previewer. ZSNES will automatically load the generated save state when 
the emulator is loaded from the previewer, but for SNES9X the F1 key 
must be pressed manually to load the generated save state. If the 
emulator has problems loading the save state, make sure the 2 steps 
above have been completed. <br>The latest version of ZSNES (v1.51 as of 
this release) is supported. Snes9x v1.43 and/or its derivatives 
(rerecord, Geiger's debugger, etc.) are preferred and should work.<br>Before using the previewer, do the following: </p>
<p class="attribute">1. Make sure all editor files are in the same folder.</p>
<p class="attribute">2. Configure the emulator's save-state folder to 
read/write to the same folder as any loaded ROM. ZSNES by default 
already does this, and so does Snes9x v1.43. However, later versions of 
Snes9x will by default read/write to a "Save" folder created within the 
emulator's main folder, and if not changed it will fail to load the 
preview save state.</p>

 Self" will limit the target to other allies only, and the caster is

Target's Defense" will not subtract the target's magic defense power

 used out of battle, ie. the overworld menu. This is normally reserved 
for healing spells.<br>"9999 Damage/Heal" will kill the target in one 
strike, if the spell does not miss. Only the dummied Knock Out spell has
 this enabled by default.<br>"Hide Battle Numerals" will hide the damage

<p class="editor">Animation scripts are all battle-oriented scripts 
which include all spell, attack, item, entrance, event, and behavior 
animations. This includes all sprite behavior in battle--allies, 
monsters, spells, etc. This editor is somewhat similar to the event 
scripts editor, but several distinctions must be made.</p>
<p class="attribute">1. The inability to add or delete commands to or 
from animation scripts, due to the complicated organization of the data 
into external rather than internal subroutines.</p>
<p class="attribute">2. The flow layout orientation of subroutines: 
event scripts are straightfoward and linear, while animation scripts are
 displayed as a multi-level tree where sub-routines are displayed as 
child nodes. Subroutines can be called multiple times in the same 
script, hence the fact that changing a <span class="term" title="These are what comprise the many scripts in the ROM. Example: in the first encounter with Terrapins, an event script contains a command &quot;Engage battle, pack: 1, battlefield: [07]&quot; which initiates the battle with the Terrapins.">command</span>'s properties can alter other nodes as well.</p>
<p class="attribute">3. A greater dependency on memory slots also 
contributes to the  difficult nature of this editor. Different memory 
values can affect subsequent sub-routine pointers, such as the $68 or 
$64 <span class="term" title="These are what comprise the many scripts in the ROM.

<p class="subwindow">If this is your first time using Lazy Shell, please take the time to read the following advice:</p>
<div class="section">
<p class="section">1. When planning a hack project, the wisest thing to 
do is to make sure you have the back-up option enabled in the settings. 
Click the cog icon and check either "Create Back-up ROM on Load" or 
"Create Back-up ROM on Save" to enable it. I often hear about users 
throwing in the towel when the application corrupts the ROM, never 
having bothered to use the back-up feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="section">2. If you receive an error prompt, please follow the 
directions in the prompt window and copy ALL of the contents of the 
error message and post them to the given link in the window. Unless you 
do this, there is little hope of the bug ever being fixed unless someone
 else encounters it and posts it to the link. Keep in mind, I do read 
bug reports and I do attempt to fix the reported bugs, so your post will
 not be a waste of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="section">3. If the unfortunate occasion might arise that the 
application actually does corrupt your ROM, you can try resetting the 
corrupted elements by importing those specific elements from a fresh 
SMRPG ROM. Click the button "Import elements from another ROM" (a 
down-arrow over a small white box), select a fresh ROM, and check the 
elements you want to import.</p>
</div>
<p class="subwindow">Should you encounter any issues, errors, problems, 
or irritations using the application, please post them to one of the 
following links:<br>http://acmlm.kafuka.org/board/thread.php?id=7005<br>http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&amp;t=45572<br>Press Ctrl+Ins to copy the contents of this message box to the clipboard. Thank you for using the program.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="subwindow">Introduction</h1>
<div class="subwindow">
<p class="subwindow">Lazy Shell is a third party .NET application 
written in the C# programming language which is capable of editing a 
wide range of elements within the Super Mario RPG (US) ROM image file. 
These elements include allies, battle animations, attacks, spells, sound
 effects, music, battlefields, dialogues, fonts, effects, events, 
formations, items, shops, level/location maps, the main title, menus, 
the mine-cart maps, monsters, sprites, world maps, and more. In 
addition, it also includes a help database and a project manager to help
 organize a full hack project.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="subwindow">Program Requirements</h1>
<div class="subwindow">
<p class="subwindow">Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or higher must be installed on the system for the application to run at all.<br>Minimal system requirements:<br>512MB of RAM (1GB recommended)<br>10MB HD space (more if ROM back-ups used)</p>
</div>
<h1 class="subwindow">Main Features</h1>
<div class="subwindow">
<p class="subwindow">The editor is comprised of 21 individual editors. <br>Various
 status editors include modification capabilities for the statuses of 
monsters, formations, formation packs, items, spells, attacks, shops, 
new game properties, level-ups, and timing properties. The monsters 
editor contains a battle script editor for each monster. <br>The Levels 
portion allows the user to modify the maps of areas (aka locations) 
using a paint-like interface, the NPCs (ie the sprites in the maps), the
 exit fields (aka entrances), event fields, overlaps, and the basic 
layering properties. A template creator/editor lets the user to store a 
separate portion of the map composed of all 3 layers and the physical 
layer into a single file. <br>The two scripts editors in Lazy Shell 
enable the user to modify the event scripts, action scripts, and 
animations scripts. Commands within event scripts and action scripts may
 be added, modified, deleted, moved, or copied and pasted. Commands 
within animation scripts may be modified, moved, or replaced with new 
commands of the same or smaller length, but adding/deleting entirely new
 commands within animations is not supported and never will be due to 
the fickle and erratic nature of the animation script engine. <br>The 
Sprites editor is able to modify a sprite's graphics, palette, and 
animations. The effects editor allows the user to edit spell effects and
 their respective graphics, palettes, and animations. <br>In the 
Dialogue editor, the user may view and edit the dialogues (aka the game 
script) as well as the dialogues which appear in battles and the 
graphics of the dialogue background tiles. Fonts, font colors, and a new
 font generator will let the user create an entirely new font table 
based upon manual editing or a supportive font installed on the OS.<br>In
 the World Maps editor World maps, world map palettes, and the locations
 that appear on world maps can be modified. The logo banner graphics and
 palettes can be modified as well.<br>The Audio editor can export, 
import, clear, and playback the audio samples used by the SPC engine. 
The .wav files can be edited in a third party program such as Audacity. 
SPC data can be edited in a variety of ways, allowing the user to create
 entirely new pieces of music. Instruments can be changed as well as 
well as the raw SPC track data, which can even import custom scripts 
from a text document.<br>The mini-games editor so far can modify the 
minecart mini game maps for all four stages and the objects in the same 
manner as levels. The menus editor allows the user to modify the menu 
palettes and import an external image into the menu backgrounds, as well
 as import an image into the frame image.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="subwindow">Extra Features</h1>
<div class="subwindow">
<p class="subwindow">The portions of the editor have tooltips for almost
 every single control. Just press F1 (or click the ? buttons found in 
most editors) and move the mouse over a control to see what that 
property is for. There is also a conversion tooltip for showing the 
hexadecimal or decimal value for the value in the control when moving 
the mouse cursor over it. Press F2 to enable this feature, or click the 
base conversion button found in most editors. <br>Users are also able to
 import and export many elements from previously exported .dat, .bin, or
 .pal files in all portions of the editor as a means of backing up or 
inter-changing elements. Clearing/erasing data is managed as well so as 
to free up space for new scripts or dialogues. <br>The notes database 
manager was written for the editor to aid the user aiming to create a 
full or partial hack. Indexes for elements such as monsters, levels, 
etc. can be added and a user-defined description provided as well. 
Adding new indexes is simplified with an option for adding a specific 
index within a portion of the editor by right- clicking the name list or
 index number. The user can also load a selected index in the notes 
database manager into its respective portion of the editor where it can 
be modified there.<br>The patch feature reads a list of patches from the
 currently defined patch server http:// or ftp:// location and can apply
 those patches to the currently loaded ROM image.<br>A previewer for 
levels, event scripts and battle scripts lets the user load a temporary 
ROM created from the current modifications in the currently loaded ROM 
image into an emulator of choice (the only options so far are ZSNES and 
SNES9X). Lazy Shell will create a save state which, when loaded, will 
immediately enter the current level or initiate the current event or 
battle script.<br>There are many more smaller features which are too 
numerous to list here, and are scattered throughout the editor with the 
purpose of easing the use of Lazy Shell and reducing the amount of work 
required to complete a task.<br>That's what all of these extra features 
are here for. Not as bells and whistles, but for making the hacking 
process less headache-inducing.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="subwindow">Unsupported Features</h1>
<div class="subwindow">
<p class="subwindow">Lazy Shell can NOT edit the new game intro sequence
 and graphics, the end credits graphics, or end credits fonts. It cannot
 make any changes to 65c816 assembly code in the ROM image (with some 
small exceptions). Additionally, ROM expansion is also not supported by 
the application due to the complications of the SA-1 chip in the game's 
engine.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="subwindow">Using the Previewer</h1>
<div class="subwindow">
<p class="subwindow">Before using the previewer, do the following: <br>1. Make sure all editor files are in the same folder. <br>2.
 Configure the emulator's save-state folder to read/write to the same 
folder as any loaded ROM. ZSNES by default already does this, and so 
does Snes9x v1.43. However, later versions of Snes9x will by default 
read/write to a "Save" folder created within the emulator's main folder,
 and if not changed it will fail to load the preview save state. <br>Choose
 either the SNES9X or ZSNES emulator file to use when opening the 
previewer. ZSNES will automatically load the generated save state when 
the emulator is loaded from the previewer, but for SNES9X the F1 key 
must be pressed manually to load the generated save state. If the 
emulator has problems loading the save state, make sure the 2 steps 
above have been completed. <br>The latest version of ZSNES (v1.51 as of 
this release) is supported. Snes9x v1.43 and/or its derivatives 
(rerecord, Geiger's debugger, etc.) are preferred and should work. </p>
</div>
<h1 class="subwindow">Importing Custom WAVs</h1>
<div class="subwindow">
<p class="subwindow">TIPS: follow these steps to successfully import a 
.WAV file of your choosing. Say you have a .WAV file, "MyWavFile.wav", 
that you wish to replace one of the samples in this audio editor with. 
Here are the steps you need to take: <br>1. Download and install Audacity, a good free audio editing program.<br>     http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/<br>2. In the Lazy Shell audio editor, export any sample to a file named "OldSample.wav".<br>3. Open "MyWavFile.wav" into Audacity.<br>4. While in Audacity, copy the audio data (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C). Close Audacity.<br>5. Open "OldSample.wav" into Audacity.<br>6. While in Audacity, paste the copied audio data over the old data (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+V).<br>7. Export to a .WAV file named "NewSample.wav".<br>8. In the Lazy Shell audio editor, import "NewSample.wav".<br>MAKE SURE THE SELECTED Hz SAMPLE RATE IS THE SAME AS THE IMPORTED .WAV FILE.<br>The
 reason this is the only way to do it is because by using the same 
exported file ("OldSample.wav") with the modified WAV data from 
"MyWavFile.wav", it retains some obscure data from "OldSample.wav" in 
"NewSample.wav" which is necessary to have in order to successfully 
import a .WAV file.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="subwindow">Bugs, errors, exceptions and complications in functionality.</h1>
<div class="subwindow">
<p class="subwindow">The editor may occasionally crash or not function 
properly due to certain errors in the code (although with each new 
bugfix I am aiming to completely remove the possibility of this ever 
happening). Please remember that this is almost certainly the 
programmer's fault and NOT yours, the user's. As often is the case, when
 an error surfaces or the program behaves in a buggy fashion, the user 
tends to immediately feel that they are to blame or the programmer is 
blaming them for the error. This is not correct: almost all of the time,
 it's the programmer's fault. Incidences when it might be the fault of 
the user may be due to a corrupt ROM being loaded (a corrupt ROM 
basically means any SMRPG rom which has been modified in any way, shape 
or form). This includes a ROM edited by Lazy Shell, but errors may occur
 if a ROM has been modified outside of Lazy Shell (ie. a hex editor), or
 often times in much older versions of Lazy Shell (v2.5 seems to be 
popular among users who find problems with v3.x).<br>If the editor 
crashes, make sure it is the latest version of Lazy Shell by clicking 
the "(i)" button in the main window and comparing the version there to 
the version posted on the home page 
(http://home.comcast.net/~giangurgolo/smrpg/).<br>If you are using the latest version, make a new post in one of these threads:<br>http://acmlm.kafuka.org/board/thread.php?id=7005<br>http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&amp;t=45572<br>Explain
 exactly what you did to produce this error or cause this 
disfunctionality to occur, what editor it was in, what order you did 
your actions to produce this error or disfunctionality, etc. Also, when 
the editor bugs out, an exception prompt appears. If you can manage to 
copy the error message after this:<br>************** Exception Text **************<br>and
 include it in your post, it will definitely help. But most importantly,
 you must explain in your post what you did. Only posting the exception 
text alone will not be adequate enough.<br>The suggestions above are 
only suggestions. Sometimes only five words might be enough for me to 
quickly locate the bug and fix it. Remember, an error or bug is most 
likely NOT YOUR FAULT. Don't be afraid to report an error should it 
occur. I do notice and try to fix every bug that is reported, so your 
post won't be in vain (unless you're making a request for an addition to
 the editor, which I am now ignoring due to how time-consuming it can 
be).</p>

changes you made. This is because during sound effect playback the data 
is read from the memory instead of directly from the ROM, and all sound 
effect data is stored to memory when the ROM starts. The previewer, 
though, will let you hear the changes since the modified data is stored

<h1 class="entry">Why do the images I import decrease in quality?<br></h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">The number of colors are reduced to 15 (or 3 in 2bpp 
cases). So if you're trying to import a Caravaggio painting, you won't 
have much luck keeping the quality. Palettes are 16 or 4 colors, with 
the first color being reserved for transparent pixels.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="entry">What's a .dat file?<br></h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">Exported elements into external files that can be imported into other indexes of the same element.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="entry">My ROM hack's checksum is bad/failed!<br></h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">Only fresh, unsaved, unmodified ROMs will have a good 
checksum (0x3bb4). The ROM's checksum always fails after a save. It's 
not a bug because the slightest change in the ROM data will create a bad
 checksum. However if you are loading a fresh, supposedly unaltered ROM 
and get a failed checksum, then there may be issues.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="entry">The editor crashes, regardless of what ROM is loaded.<br></h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">Try resetting the settings. Click the cog icon in the main window and click "Default..." to reset the settings.</p>

<h1 class="entry">Sometimes it asks to save even if I haven't done anything.<br></h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">In some editors, like the sprites editor, switching 
between indexes will reassemble the last loaded index's data thus 
changing the data in the process. This is not a bug, and none of the

<h1 class="entry">What are Lazy Shell's most powerful features?<br></h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">1. The "Import Image(s)" functions in the sprites and 
effects editors allow the user to replace existing sprites with entirely
 new sprite animations from external image files. These were quite 
difficult to write the code for, but very rewarding in that they 
ultimately added a lot more muscle to the editor.<br>2. The <span class="term" title="A set of colors used to draw something. Almost all palettes are 16 colors, except for layer 3 graphics, fonts, and some effect graphics.

 editor's "Adjust RGB" and "Effects" features let the user apply all 
kinds of effects to the colors, from RGB swapping, grayscale, 
contrast/brightness, colorizing, and more. You can create your own <span class="term" title="A set of colors used to draw something.

            </h1>
<div class="glossary_box"><a name="2bpp &amp; 4bpp"></a><h1 class="entry">2bpp &amp; 4bpp</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">These mean "2 bits per pixel" and "4 bits per pixel", 
and refer to the format that graphics are in. Graphics in 2bpp format 
can only use a maximum of 4 colors, whereas 4bpp graphics can use up to 
16 colors. The Big Boo in Bowser's Terrorize spell only needs 4 colors, 
thus the graphics are in 2bpp format to conserve ROM space.</p>
</div><a name="action queue"></a><h1 class="entry">action queue</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">A group of commands in an event script which behave 
like a custom embedded action script, containing movement commands for a
 given NPC.</p>
</div><a name="action script"></a><h1 class="entry">action script</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">A script comprised of commands which create a series of
 movements ascribed to an NPC in a level. A townsperson walking back and
 forth randomly is controlled by an action script. A wiggler's unique 
behavior is governed by a special action script.</p>
</div><a name="AMEM"></a><h1 class="entry">AMEM</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">1. Audio memory, used to store SPC and sample data.<br>2. Animation memory, used in animation scripts to store sub-routine flags.</p>
</div><a name="animation script"></a><h1 class="entry">animation script</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">The scripts which animate everything seen in battle. 
Attacks, spells, events, etc. are all governed by animation scripts. 
Animation scripts are, like battle and event scripts, written in their 
own scripting language. The animation scripting language is the most 
complicated and difficult to write for, as they tend to jump around 
wildly throughout the current bank by means of animation packets and 
memory-checking mini-scripts. The animations editor contains many 
powerful features, but unfortunately also many limitations on 
innovation. Some scripts are painfully large because many of the 
mini-scripts within a script are repeated numerous times.</p>
</div><a name="ASM"></a><h1 class="entry">ASM</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">This is essentially the game's raw code which runs when
 the game is started. SNES games are generally written in assembly. Most
 everything that Lazy Shell modifies is arranged in data chunks and 
dynamic scripts and does not involve assembly programming code. Anything
 Lazy Shell is incapable of modifying, outside of the defense timing 
values. "ASM hacking" is modifying the assembly code outside of Lazy 
Shell.</p>
</div><a name="bit"></a><h1 class="entry">bit</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">These behave like flags or switches that are turned on 
or off. The game knows what has been done so far in the game because of 
the bits that are set or clear. Defeating the Hammer Bros. sets a bit. 
Each time you enter that level, an event script checks if the switch is 
turned on in order to determine whether or not to show the Hammer Bros 
NPC and execute the associated cut scene. The "Jump" bit is already 
switched on when you start a new game, and can be switched off in the 
allies editor. Checkboxes in the editor are usually associated with 
bit-wise data while number values are byte-wise. Example: monster HP is 
read byte-wise while elemental weaknesses are read bit-wise.</p>
</div><a name="command"></a><h1 class="entry">command</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">These are what comprise the many scripts in the ROM. 
Example: in the first encounter with Terrapins, an event script contains
 a command "Engage battle, pack: 1, battlefield: [07]" which initiates 
the battle with the Terrapins.</p>
</div><a name="element"></a><h1 class="entry">element</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">The different things in the ROM that Lazy Shell can 
modify. The individual editors can usually edit one or two types of 
elements. Elements often have multiple indexes. Monsters are an element 
that has 256 indexes (0 to 255). Levels are another element that 
contains 510 indexes, event scripts have 4096 indexes.</p>
</div><a name="event script"></a><h1 class="entry">event script</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">The game basically progresses by event scripts. 
Everything you see happening in a level that isn't controlled by the 
player (ie. Mario) is executed by the commands in an event script. 
Scripts are usually initialized by a trigger in the level, when Mario 
comes into contact with either an event field or an NPC. An event script
 is also automatically initialized every time when entering a new level.
 This script is the level's own event script (set with the "EVENT #") 
that usually contains commands for preparing primarily NPC and memory 
related elements before the level is completely loaded.</p>
</div><a name="event field"></a><h1 class="entry">event field</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">A field which, when Mario touches it, will initiate an 
event script. Event fields can actually be made to behave exactly like 
exit fields and they often are when other commands must be executed. In 
these cases the scripts contain a command pointing to the target level.</p>
</div><a name="exit field"></a><h1 class="entry">exit field</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">A field which, when Mario touches it, will load a new level. Other ROM editors sometimes call these "entrances".</p>
</div><a name="field"></a><h1 class="entry">field</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">An invisible thing in a level that triggers an event or operation when Mario touches it. Event and exit fields, for example.</p>
</div><a name="hex"></a><h1 class="entry">hex</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">A numeric system who's places are based on 16's and not
 10's like in "decimal". With just one decimal place, you can count up 
to 9, but in just one hexadecimal place you can go up to 15. This is 
because the numbers 10-15 are A-F respectively. Thus in just two 
hexadecimal places the numbers can go up to 255, which is why this 
number is so common throughout the editor. With three hex places, 4096 
is highest. The editor displays only memory addresses in hex format (eg.
 00:709F) with all other elements being in decimal.</p>
</div><a name="index"></a><h1 class="entry">index</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">Example: TERRAPIN is an index in the monster element 
(index 0). The level for Mario's Pad is index 16 in the levels element, 
etc. You can modify the properties of each index by switching to or 
among them in the editors using either its drop down list or immediately
 with its numeric up/down.</p>
</div><a name="isometric"></a><h1 class="entry">isometric</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">The pseudo 3-D orientation of Super Mario RPG. Other 
games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre are isometrically 
oriented. Something is called "isometric" when, instead of being in a 
flat gridplane, it is shaped like a diamond and arranged at an angle. 
Nevertheless Mario RPG's levels are drawn with square 16x16 tiles and 
not diamond-shaped tiles, whereas the collision tiles are.</p>
</div><a name="layer"></a><h1 class="entry">layer</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">SMRPG uses five layers: L1, L2, L3, NPCs, BG. By 
default, NPCs appear on top of all other layers (excluding priority 1 
tiles). After that, L1 appears on top, followed by L2, L3, and BG. The 
BG is simply the solid background color behind everything else.</p>
</div><a name="level"></a><h1 class="entry">level</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">The places and areas you can enter in-game. Many ROM editors also refer to these as "locations".</p>
</div><a name="memory address"></a><h1 class="entry">memory address</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">A "slot" where the game stores information that it 
needs to access later. Example: the 30 slots for items (7F:F882 to 
7F:F89F) have memory addresses. The memory addresses are the items. 
Completed events, like defeating the Hammer Bros (00:7052, bit 6), are 
stored as a bit in a memory address. A memory address has 8 bits.</p>
</div><a name="mode 7"></a><h1 class="entry">mode 7</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">Mode 7 is a format in SNES which can display a 2D map 
in a 3D manner. The 1st and 2nd mine cart levels are in mode 7 format, 
for instance. It can also do transformations such as the stretching 
effect on the world maps.</p>
</div><a name="mods"></a><h1 class="entry">mods</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">These can change the tiles or collision tiles of a 
level. In the levels editor, there are two types of mods: tile mods and 
collision mods. Example: Croco blowing up the wall in Moleville Mines. 
Example: the green button in Rose Town removing/adding stairs outside.</p>
</div><a name="mold"></a><h1 class="entry">mold</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">An arrangement of tiles that form a complete image (ie.
 a sprite image). A mold is similar to the orientation of a tilemap, 
except that sprite molds can either be in a format that arranges the 
tiles in a grid (gridplane) or a coordinate system (tilemap). One or 
more molds may be contained in a sprite or effect and are used to create
 a sequence animation.</p>
</div><a name="NPC"></a><h1 class="entry">NPC</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">Abbreviation for "non-playable character". They are 
basically the sprites seen in-game in a level, excluding battles, but 
with a number of properties all described by the help tags in the levels
 editor. An NPC is not the same as a sprite, it merely has a sprite 
index assigned to it among a bunch of other attributes.</p>
</div><a name="OMEM"></a><h1 class="entry">OMEM</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">Object memory, referring to the object packets used in 
animation scripts. Each time a $68 or $64 command is called a memory 
address block is accessible exclusively by the current object, assigned 
by the parameters $68 or $64 commands.</p>
</div><a name="palette"></a><h1 class="entry">palette</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">A set of colors used to draw something. Almost all 
palettes are 16 colors, except for layer 3 graphics, fonts, and some 
effect graphics. SNES games like SMRPG are somewhat limited in the 
number of colors they can display, which is why imported image files can
 decrease dramatically in quality. Many paint programs have features 
which can decrease the color depth of an image to 16 colors.</p>
</div><a name="priority"></a><h1 class="entry">priority</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">A tile or sprite's priority determines how it will 
overlap other tiles or how other tiles will overlap it. "Priority 1" 
means someting will overlap all other parts of a level that aren't also 
set to priority 1. Higher priority numbers mean it will appear under 
other things. Highlighting priority 1 tiles in a level will show what 
parts of the level will typically overlap Mario and NPCs.</p>
</div><a name="script"></a><h1 class="entry">script</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">A list of 0 or more commands that carry out an action 
on screen in the game, such as Toad running into Mario near the 
beginning of the game, or Bowser's "Crusher" battle animation, or The 
Big Boo randomly selecting either "Lighting Orb" or "Bolt" to use in 
battle. Examples: event scripts, action scripts, battle scripts, 
animations.</p>
</div><a name="sequence"></a><h1 class="entry">sequence</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">An animation. Two types of elements use sequences: 
sprites and effects. A sequence is a collection of frames. Each frame is
 assigned a mold index from the sprite or effect's mold collection and 
plays back the frames as a fully animated sequence.</p>
</div><a name="collision"></a><h1 class="entry">collision</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">Also varyingly called called "physical field" or 
"collision tiles". The physical properties of something, like a map. 
Levels in most games have collision maps, but usually as tilesets 
associated with the regular graphical tileset. As tilesets in SMRPG are 
grid-based and not isometric like the collision tiles, the tilemaps and 
not the tilesets have their own collision maps.</p>
</div><a name="tilemap"></a><h1 class="entry">tilemap</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">An example: Levels are 64 rows of tiles, each row is 64
 tiles. Many sprites are "tilemaps" themselves, but here each tile would
 have its own coordinate instead of being placed in a grid like levels. 
Do not mistake tilemaps with tilesets. "tileset" A collection or 
"palette" of tiles used to draw to a tilemap.</p>
</div><a name="trigger"></a><h1 class="entry">trigger</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p class="entry">When Mario comes into contact with something like an 
NPC or event field, and an event script is initiated, it is "triggered".
 NPCs have a trigger property which sets the conditions for the script's
 initiation when Mario collides with it.</p>
